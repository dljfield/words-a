This is a single-page application written with AngularJS and Laravel acting as a blogging platform. The purpose is to learn how to use both AngularJS and Laravel to create applications.

This has been abandoned in favour of a different approach, starting from a more traditional base in order to create a usable version 1 more quickly, which will then be enhanced with JavaScript on top.

WIP

TODO:

*These just need to be ported over from the previous version*

- ~~Ability to create new posts~~

*Actually new stuff to implement*
- Ability to publish unpublished posts
- Save login sessioin
- Live markdown editor
